## Abstract

With the growing use of machine learning, especially deep learning, in ECG analysis, access to well-annotated databases has become increasingly important. However, most public ECG databases lack detailed QRS morphology labels or complete 12-lead ECG recordings. Manual annotation remains essential but is time-consuming, subjective, and often requires multiple reviewers. CardioMark is an open-access MATLAB toolbox that simplifies and improves ECG annotation through an intuitive graphical interface. It supports multi-observer input, session-based work, and easy export for machine learning applications. Its modular design allows customization for various ECG tasks, making it a useful tool for both research and education in clinical cardiology.

## Requirements
This software requires only a basic **MATLAB** . 
**Tested on MATLAB 2024b**

## Installation
The software can be run by adding its folder to the MATLAB search path and opening **“CardioMark.mlapp”** or by installing the **“CardioMark V1.0.mlappinstall”** file; then the software can be found in the APPS menu in MATLAB.
